# Git Presentation
used to demonstrate some basic/intermediate git/GitHub usage

### Commits

-   Make commits of logical units

-   First line should simply be a brief summary of the issue
    "Issue #1 Integrate flask into iOS app"

-   Preferably have the Github Issues number somewhere in the PR title

-   Should be a readable, full-sentence explanation of what the commit does and
    the changes in it

-   Avoid committing commented out code (excluding TODOs), definitely avoid committing
    code that doesn't run or is broken in some way
